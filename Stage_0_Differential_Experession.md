# Differential expression; Downregulation and Upregulation
## Introduction 
Differential expression is the expression pattern of certain genes in different conditions like different experimental condition, cell type, disease stage, treatment condition and other variables. It can be used to understand the disease mechanism and identify responsible genes or proteins by comparing their expression pattern in the diseased and healthy tissue. Additionally, suitable biomarker for early detection of cancer can also be identified by analyzing the expression level of genes in early stage and late stage cancer. This techniques enables as to catchup cancer before getting worse. Moreover, it can also applied in measuring the treatment efficiency (Costa-Silva et al., 2017).  
## Differentially expressed genes
Differentially expressed genes are genes which show significance expression level difference in different conditions like diseased and healthy tissue. Identifying differentially expressed genes from high-through put sequencing data like RNA-Seq and Microarray is essential in identification of biomarker, knowing the disease mechanism, and identifying drug target. RNA-Seq, or high-throughput sequencing, has emerged as the preferred method for determining expression levels(Costa-Silva et al., 2017). Differential expression analysis if performed using different analysis pipelines and bioinformatics techniques to select the most significant genes and proteins which can be used for further application (Rosati et al., 2024). A matrix of counts, or the number of reads mapping to each relevant genomic feature in each sample, provides the input for all differential expression analysis algorithms that are publicly available within the R framework (Soneson & Delorenzi, 2013).
## Downregulation 
Down regulation is where the expression level of genes decreased comparing to reference and control group. This indicate that particular group have low RNA production which subsequently have low protein level translated from RNA. Reduction in genes expression may be due to the effect of treatment which suppress transcription factor and change chromatin structure (Rashid et al., 2021). 
## Upregulation 
Upregulation is the opposite of down regulation. Upregulation is a condition in which the expression level of genes increased in one condition compared to the other. This means this condition results more RNA transcribes from DNA. For example, if the genes in cancer cell expressed more, it may suggest this gene contributing more to the cancerous nature of the cell (Rashid et al., 2021). 
## Conclusion 
Gene expression is the most useful method to identify the expression level of genes. It is mainly based on looking the pattern of expression of different genes in two different samples or groups. The high-trough put RNA-Seq data is most commonly used to analyze the significance gene expression level of different genes. During comparison if certain gene expressed below the reference or control group it is designate as down regulated.
